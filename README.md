Polling is a one of the technologies to communicate data in real-time operation. 
In the real-time communication of data, it has to be achieved sending data in the smallest delay.

In general speaking, it takes a time to sensing an environment and sending the obtained data.
For example, in the case of sensing of the human being, time delay between sensing and movement
is about 0.2 second.
