# Polling

Polling is a one of the technologies to communicate data in real-time operation. 
In the real-time communication of data, it has to be achieved sending data in the smallest delay.

## In general speaking, 
it takes a time to sensing an environment and sending the obtained data.
For example, in the case of sensing of the human being, time delay between sensing and movement
is about 0.2 second.
Shorter dela-time brings a better responce to realize the real-time movement or other reactions.

In also a robot programing and intelligence, short responce-time brings better real-time performance.
This means that a short sending time is needed to realize the real-time intelligence to move the robot.
