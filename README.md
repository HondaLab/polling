# Polling

Polling is a one of the technologies to communicate data in real-time operation. 
In the real-time communication of data, it has to be achieved sending data in the smallest delay.

## In general speaking, 
it takes a time to sensing an environment and sending the obtained data.
For example, in the case of human beging, sensing time delay between sensing and movement
is about 0.2 second.
Shorter delay-time brings a better responce to realize the real-time movement or other reactions.

In also a robot programing and intelligence, short responce-time brings better real-time performance.
This means that a short sending time is needed to realize the real-time intelligence to move the robot.

## Polling to realize the real-time sending data
It is simple to realize the polling in sending data.
The speed of recieving data should be faster than that of sensing.
For example if it would take 0.1 sec. to sensing environment, the program is able to send data
about 10 time in a second.
